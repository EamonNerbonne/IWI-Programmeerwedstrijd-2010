The fare dodgers and ticket inspectors take turns

Each turn first all fare dodgers move and then all inspectors move.

\Input
\begin{itemize}
 %\item A line with a single positive integer $n < 100$, the number of cars in the train.
 \item A line with a two positive integer $n < 100$ and $t < 100$, the number of cars in the train and the duration of the trip in turns.
 \item A line with $2n$ characters, describing each compartment on the top floor of the train.
       A `d' indicates that a compartment contains a fare dodger,
         `i' indicates that a compartment contains a ticket inspector,
         `.' indicates a compartment with only paying passengers.
       The staircases are initially empty.
 \item A line with $2n$ characters, describing each compartment on the bottom floor of the train.
\end{itemize}

\Output
\begin{itemize}
 \item One line containing a single integer, the number of fare dodgers that can escape.
\end{itemize}
